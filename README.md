# Static-Portfolio-Optimisation-Dashboard

**Introduction:**

The project developed a dashboard tailored for investors with limited investment expertise who have already identified up to five stocks they wish to invest in. The dashboard retrieves historical stock price data by scraping tickers from Yahoo.finance and uses the Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) approach to forecast future prices and optimize the portfolio according to the investor's risk preferences. This functionality provides investors with valuable insights into the optimal allocation of their investments across the selected stocks. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, featuring various interactive elements such as input fields, sliders, and visualizations, including data tables and charts.

**Files:**

The **"Dashboard.pdf"** documents the overview of dashboard functionality, methodology, instructions on setting up the project, and the resources.

For documentation purposes, the code is divided into two parts:

**"functions.py"**: the functions that power the dashboard. 

**"Statistic Portfolio Optimization Dashboard.py"**: the complete implementation of where these functions are imported and how the dashboard is created.

Python version 3.11.9
