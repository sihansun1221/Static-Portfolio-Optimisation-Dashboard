# Static-Portfolio-Optimisation-Dashboard

**Introduction:**
The project developed a dashboard tailored for investors with limited investment expertise who have already identified up to five stocks they wish to invest in. The dashboard retrieves historical stock price data by scraping tickers from Yahoo.finance and uses the Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) approach to forecast future prices and optimize the portfolio according to the investor's risk preferences. This functionality provides investors with valuable insights into the optimal allocation of their investments across the selected stocks. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, featuring various interactive elements such as input fields, sliders, and visualizations, including data tables and charts.

The Dashboard.pdf documents the explanation of dashboard functionality, methodology, instructions on how to set up the project, and the resources.
